# youtube-clip-sharing
Users can share parts of a video on the web app. Meaning, they specify a YouTube url, comment, start & end second.
Other users can view the clips and like it. For now, no authentication is implemented, so everyone can like a clip as many times as they want as long as they reload the page.
I am using Node.js and NeDB for the database management.

**Required packages**:
```
npm install nedb
```
